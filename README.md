# SSH Launcher

A very simple program, it parses your SSH configuration file at `C:/Users/username/.ssh/config` and presents a list. Selecting an item from that list launches a new SSH session in Windows Terminal.

This is a UWP app. Compiled using Visual Studio 2019, but probably works elsewhere. I'm just being lazy and following tutorials.
